<section class="about">
	<p>I've lived all over the world: New Jersey, Shanghai, California, New Zealand, Hong Kong and now Taipei. I graduated from the University of California at Davis just this June, and now I'm looking for a place to settle down and trying to make the quintile-life crisis into a thing.</p>
<p>I love learning new stuff (I taught myself how to code this website in about five days), writing short stories and small games and eating fancy cakes in cute cafes. So far, my <a href="taipeimap.html">time in Taipei</a> is enabling all three habits.</p>
