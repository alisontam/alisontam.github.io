I've done some stuff in Twine and Ren'py, and worked on some larger projects with the UC Davis Mod Lab. I'm fascinated by interactive fiction: the best part about making a game for me is having the ability to make a story develop seven different ways at once. Here are some of the games I've made:</section>

I was the first intern on the UC Davis Mod Lab's Play the Knave, a motion-capture Shakespeare karaoke game on Steam here. I started out scripting, or coding and adapting Shakespeare's original plays to fit the game files, but eventually moved to the social media and publicity team. I also developed positions for and recruited more interns, growing our intern team from one to thirty.<br></section>

I wrote, programmed and produced this game in a month for the GameCamp Game Jam, leading a team of three to create a short visual novel that eventually won the jam's Innovation Prize. The time crunch was definitely a challenge, especially since I had to balance working on the jam with classes and extracurricular student government work, but we ended up with a product that I'm proud of.<br></section>

		<h3><a href="https://storytam.itch.io/lesbian-vampire-dating-online">LESBIAN VAMPIRE DATING ONLINE</a></h3>
		A short game I made for YuriJam 2017. I challenged myself to create interesting and fun characters from just a few lines of description and dialogue, and ended up with a game where you help your friend navigate a vampire-specific online dating app.
