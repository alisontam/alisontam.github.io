<li><a href="https://storytam.itch.io/betrayal-on-the-raptors-claw?secret=uLfYB4raVxjRXaiu3fsR1QW02wY">Betrayal On The Raptor's Claw</a>:I wrote, programmed and produced this game in a month for the GameCamp Game Jam, leading a team of three to create a short visual novel that eventually won the jam's Innovation Prize. The time crunch was definitely a challenge, especially since I had to balance working on the jam with classes and extracurricular student government work, but we ended up with a product that I'm proud of.<br></section>
