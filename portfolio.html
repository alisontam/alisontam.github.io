		Dappervolk is an all-ages pet site/RPG hybrid set in a fantastical, quirky world. I took on a host of different characters, from a stern shark priest to a mysterious forest witch, and a variety of storylines, including both casual daily quests and more involved romantic and dramatic plotlines.<br></section>

<h3><a href="https://storytam.itch.io/betrayal-on-the-raptors-claw?secret=uLfYB4raVxjRXaiu3fsR1QW02wY">Betrayal On The Raptor's Claw</a></h3>
I wrote, programmed and produced this game in a month for the GameCamp Game Jam, leading a team of three to create a short visual novel that eventually won the jam's Innovation Prize. The time crunch was definitely a challenge, especially since I had to balance working on the jam with classes and extracurricular student government work, but we ended up with a product that I'm proud of.<br></section>

		<h3><a href="https://storytam.itch.io/lesbian-vampire-dating-online">LESBIAN VAMPIRE DATING ONLINE</a></h3>
		A short game I made for YuriJam 2017. I challenged myself to create interesting and fun characters from just a few lines of description and dialogue, and ended up with a game where you help your friend navigate a vampire-specific online dating app.
