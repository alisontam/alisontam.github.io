$prompt character
Dirtbag girls who are kind of like…… they don’t know what the fuck is going on and eat stuff off the floor and engage in acts of pointless destruction and also love to steal. Niti & I have talked about this
The ones who are really, really good at emotional labor, and take pride in it, and use stuff like active listening and empathy and social links to get things done. But also they’re probably very bitter about not being appreciated and hold everyone to their impossibly high standards.
The Celebrated Wit, star of her social circle, holder of a precarious position, bound by the strictures of her society, not especially malicious but often carelessly cruel.
Very noble, stoic girls who try a lot to do the Right Thing and are probably very powerful but also easily outmaneuvered bc of their rigid moral code.
True Fuckboi Spirit: Quite self-aggrandizing but also ridiculously good-natured, thinks they’re the best thing in the world with maybe .5 of a thing to back up that assertion, probably thinks you’re best friends even though. You are not best friends.
What is this Macchiavelli bullshit: she’s always 5 billion steps ahead of everyone with 9000 goddamn contingency plans. Or at least, she thinks she is. Actual efficacy varies but she likes to plan and overplan and thinks she knows what everyone will do but never factors in for actual sentiment.
