<p>But if you'd like to get to know me a little better, feel free to check out the <a href="index.html">rest of my website</a>. It's a little rough (I taught myself how to build this site in about five days), but I've got some cool stuff around here. Maybe you'd like to see <a href="taipeimap.html">a map of my favorite places in Taipei</a>?</p>
